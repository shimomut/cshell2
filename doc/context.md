# Context System Design

## Overview

The context system provides named environments that bundle variables and a working directory. Switching contexts restores the associated state, making it easy to work across multiple environments (e.g., AWS accounts, projects, clusters) within a single shell session.

Contexts also serve as the unit of **process multiplexing**: each context can hold a live PTY subprocess. Pressing `Ctrl+]` opens a picker to switch between contexts; if the target context has a running process, it is resumed immediately without being killed.

## Data Model

### ContextState

```python
class ContextState(Enum):
    IDLE    = auto()   # no process attached
    RUNNING = auto()   # process_slot.is_alive() is True
    EXITED  = auto()   # process finished but slot not yet cleaned up
```

### Context

```python
@dataclass
class Context:
    name: str                           # unique identifier
    variables: dict[str, str]           # key-value pairs exported to os.environ
    cwd: str                            # saved working directory
    process_slot: ProcessSlot | None    # optional running subprocess

    @property
    def state(self) -> ContextState: ...  # derived from process_slot
```

A context captures:
- **Variables**: exported to `os.environ` on activation, restored on deactivation. Subprocesses inherit these automatically.
- **Working directory**: saved when leaving, restored when entering. Each context remembers where you were.
- **Process slot**: an optional PTY-backed subprocess. When a context has a live process and is switched away from, the process keeps running and its output is buffered until you switch back.

### ContextManager

```python
class ContextManager:
    contexts: dict[str, Context]     # all known contexts by name
    current_name: str | None         # which context is active
    stack: list[str]                 # name history for push/pop
```

The manager maintains:
- A **named collection** of all contexts (addressable by name)
- A **current pointer** indicating the active context
- A **stack** for push/pop navigation (stores names, not copies)
- A **display order** list (current context always first in `context list`)

## Operations

### Push (create + switch)

```
context push prod
```

Creates a new context named `prod` with variables inherited from the current context. The current context's name is appended to the stack before switching. The `cwd` is captured at creation time.

> **Note:** Variables are not set at push time. Use the `var` command after pushing:
> ```
> cshell2> context push prod
> [prod] cshell2> var ACCOUNT=123456 REGION=us-east-1
> ```

### Switch

```
context switch staging
```

Directly sets the current pointer to any existing context. Does not modify the stack. The previous context remains available — nothing is lost.

### Pop

```
context pop
```

Removes the current context, then switches to the name at the top of the stack (or to the first remaining context if the stack is empty). The popped context is **deleted**, not just deactivated.

> **Contrast with push:** `push` saves to the stack; `pop` removes from the collection. Think of push/pop as "enter a temporary sub-environment and discard it when done."

### Kill

```
context kill <name>
```

Sends SIGTERM to the running process in the named context. The context itself is not removed.

### Variables

```
var KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...]    # set one or more context variables
var                              # list all current environment variables
unset KEY [KEY ...]              # remove variables from context and os.environ
```

`var` sets variables on the **current context** and immediately exports them to `os.environ`. They will be re-applied whenever this context is switched to.

### Ctrl+] — Live Context Switch

Pressing `Ctrl+]` at the shell prompt (or during a running process) opens an inline picker listing all contexts. Each entry shows:
- A `*` marker for the current context
- The name of the running command (if any) as a right-aligned label

Selecting a context:
- If it has a live process: the shell enters forwarding mode immediately, resuming that process
- If idle: the shell switches to that context and shows its prompt

Selecting `+ new context` prompts for a name and creates a new context inheriting the current context's variables.

## Environment Variable Management

### Activation

When a context becomes active:
1. Back up the current value of each variable key in `os.environ` (or `None` if unset)
2. Set each context variable in `os.environ`

### Deactivation

When a context is deactivated:
1. For each backed-up key, restore the original value (or remove if it was `None`)

This ensures:
- Context variables don't leak between contexts
- Pre-existing environment variables aren't permanently lost
- System commands spawned via subprocess see the correct variables

### Working Directory

On switch:
1. Save `os.getcwd()` into the departing context's `cwd`
2. `os.chdir()` to the arriving context's `cwd`

This means you can `cd` around within a context, switch away, and return to find yourself back where you left off.

## Integration with Completion

Completers receive the active context via `CompletionContext.shell_context`. This enables context-aware completions:

```python
class InstanceCompleter(Completer):
    def complete(self, ctx: CompletionContext) -> list[Completion]:
        # Use explicit arg if given, otherwise inherit from context
        account = ctx.args[0] if ctx.args else (
            ctx.shell_context.get_variable("ACCOUNT") if ctx.shell_context else None
        )
        # ... fetch completions for account
```

This pattern lets commands work both ways:
- Explicitly: `connect prod us-east-1` (args override)
- Implicitly: `connect` (inherits from active context)

## State Diagram

```
Shell starts → "default" context created (IDLE, current)
                    │
               context push prod
                    │
                    ▼
         "default" ← stack ← "prod" (IDLE, current)
                    │
               run vim  (vim launches in PTY)
                    │
                    ▼
         "default" ← stack ← "prod" (RUNNING, current)
                    │
               Ctrl+] → switch to "default"
                    │
                    ▼
         "prod" (RUNNING, background)
         "default" (IDLE, current)   ← [bg:1] shown in prompt
                    │
               Ctrl+] → switch back to "prod"
                    │
                    ▼
         "prod" (RUNNING, current) ← vim resumes in foreground
                    │
               context pop  (vim still running)
                    │
                    ▼
         "default" (IDLE, current), "prod" deleted
```

## Prompt Integration

The shell prompt reflects the active context and any background activity:

- Default context (`"default"`): no context prefix shown
- Named context: `[contextname] path/cwd HH:MM:SS>`
- Background processes: `[contextname] path/cwd HH:MM:SS [bg:N]>`

The `[bg:N]` indicator shows how many other contexts (not the current one) have live running processes.

## Design Rationale

**Why named collection + stack instead of just a stack?**

A pure stack forces linear navigation — you must pop through intermediates to reach a distant context. Named contexts allow direct `switch` to any context at any time. The stack remains available as a convenience for the common "briefly enter context X, then return" pattern.

**Why export to os.environ?**

Subprocess commands (the system fallback) need to see context variables without cshell2-specific wiring. Exporting to `os.environ` means `aws`, `kubectl`, `ssh`, and other tools pick up the right account/region/cluster automatically.

**Why save cwd per context?**

Different environments often correspond to different directories (project roots, deployment repos). Saving cwd per context eliminates repetitive `cd` after every switch.

**Why PTY-per-context rather than job control?**

Traditional job control (`bg`/`fg`/`&`) is complex and exposes Unix process groups to the user. Per-context PTY slots are simpler to reason about: each context has at most one foreground process, and `Ctrl+]` is the only way to switch. The tradeoff is that you cannot have multiple background jobs within a single context — use multiple contexts instead.
