# Completion Engine Design

## Overview

The completion engine provides context-aware tab completion for all shell input. It is designed to be deeply customizable — each command declares completers for each argument position, and each completer receives full parse state to make intelligent suggestions.

## Core Types

### CompletionContext

Every completer receives a `CompletionContext` with full awareness of what's been typed:

```python
@dataclass
class CompletionContext:
    command: str | None        # command name (None if completing command itself)
    args: list[str]            # all preceding arguments (already completed)
    arg_index: int             # which argument position is being completed
    prefix: str               # partial text of current argument being completed
    line: str                 # full raw line
    shell_context: Context | None  # current shell context
```

The `shell_context` field gives completers access to the active context's variables (e.g., account, region), enabling completions that adapt to the current environment without explicit arguments.

### Completion

```python
@dataclass
class Completion:
    value: str              # the text inserted on selection
    display: str = ""       # label shown in completion menu (defaults to value)
    description: str = ""   # metadata shown beside the completion
    multi_select: bool = False   # True → opens InlineMultiPicker instead of InlinePicker
    combinable: bool = False     # True for single-char flags that can be merged (-a -l → -al)
    arg_hint: str = ""           # non-empty when flag requires a following argument (e.g. "N")
    is_arg_hint: bool = False    # True when this IS the hint for a preceding flag's value
    verbatim: bool = False       # True → value may span tokens; inserted as-is
```

Every candidate's `value` starts at the **completion anchor** — the position the
current token starts at (`parsing.raw_token_start`), which is where the editor
splices it in. `verbatim` marks one whose value may run past the end of that
token (today: history suggestions — see
[History candidates](#history-candidates)); because such a value is already
shell syntax, the editor inserts it without shell-quoting it and without
appending a trailing space.

### Completer Protocol

```python
class Completer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def complete(self, ctx: CompletionContext) -> list[Completion]:
        """Return completions for the current position."""
        ...

    def should_activate(self, ctx: CompletionContext) -> bool:
        """Optional guard — return False to skip this completer dynamically."""
        return True
```

The `should_activate` guard allows a completer to be registered at a position but only engage under certain conditions (e.g., only complete context names after `context switch`, not after `context list`).

## Built-in Completers

### FileCompleter

Completes filesystem paths relative to the current directory. Handles:
- Directory prefix expansion (`src/` lists contents of `src/`)
- Hidden file filtering (only shown when prefix starts with `.`)
- Directory suffix (`/` appended to directory completions)
- Case-insensitive matching

### DirCompleter

Like `FileCompleter` but only returns directories. Used for flags that take a directory path (e.g. `du -C DIR`).

### CommandNameCompleter

Completes command names from two sources:
1. Registered commands in the `CommandRegistry`
2. Executable files on `$PATH` (only searched when prefix is non-empty, to avoid flooding)

Results are labeled `"command"` or `"system"` in the description field.

### ChoiceCompleter

Completes from a static list of strings. Simple but covers many cases (subcommands, enum-like arguments, known account names).

```python
ChoiceCompleter(["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1"])
```

### CallbackCompleter

Completes from a function's return value. The function is called on each completion attempt, enabling dynamic lists:

```python
CallbackCompleter(lambda: get_current_branches())
```

### OptionsCompleter

Completes command-line flags. Registered under the `None` key in a completers dict so it activates at any argument position when the user types a `-`-prefixed token.

```python
OptionsCompleter(
    options={
        "-l": "long format",
        "-a": "show hidden",
        "--color": "colorize output",
        "-d": "max depth",
    },
    args={
        "-d": "N",               # hint only — user types the value
        "--color": ("WHEN", ChoiceCompleter(["always", "auto", "never"])),
        # tuple form: (hint, value_completer) → opens a picker for the value
    },
)
```

When all completions returned are `multi_select=True` (which `OptionsCompleter` always sets), the line editor opens `InlineMultiPicker` instead of `InlinePicker`. The user:
- Navigates with arrows / `Ctrl+P/N` — the list opens with **no** row highlighted, so the first Down/Up moves onto the first/last flag
- **Space** to toggle the highlighted flag's checked state
- **Enter** to confirm (checked items, or the highlighted item if nothing is checked; nothing at all if neither — the picker just closes)
- Types a letter to jump to the next flag starting with that letter

Boolean short flags are automatically merged: selecting `-a` and `-l` inserts `-al`. Flags with `arg_hint` are inserted individually followed by a space, then either a value picker or an inline hint line.

`OptionsCompleter` also handles:
- **Flag deduplication** — flags already present in `ctx.args` are excluded
- **Short-flag cluster parsing** — `-hs` in `ctx.args` is treated as both `-h` and `-s` already used
- **Preceding-flag hint** — when the last completed arg is a value-taking flag and the user presses TAB without typing `-`, the engine shows a hint instead of opening a picker

### ConditionalCompleter

Selects a sub-completer based on the preceding arguments. Useful when argument N's valid values depend on what was chosen for arguments 0..N-1:

```python
ConditionalCompleter({
    ("prod",): ChoiceCompleter(["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]),
    ("staging",): ChoiceCompleter(["us-west-2"]),
})
```

Performs longest-prefix matching on `ctx.args` against the mapping keys: tries the full `args` tuple first, then progressively shorter prefixes.

### HistoryCompleter

Completes the typed line from past command lines. It is the one completer that
*matches* in **line space**: an entry qualifies when it starts with `ctx.line`
(everything before the caret), not merely with `ctx.prefix`. What it returns is
an ordinary anchored candidate — the entry from `raw_token_start(ctx.line)`
onwards — flagged `verbatim=True` because that tail can span several tokens.

```python
HistoryCompleter(history_fn, limit=10)
```

`history_fn` returns the entries to search — the shell passes the **current
context's** in-memory Up/Down list, so TAB recall and arrow recall agree on
scope (`Ctrl+R` is the one that searches the global store). It is called on
every keystroke while a picker is open, so it must stay cheap.

Candidates are most-recent-first, deduplicated, and capped at `limit`. Entries
are skipped when they add nothing (an exact match, or one differing only by
trailing whitespace) and when they contain a newline — the value is inserted
verbatim, so a newline would submit the line on insert.

Anchoring means the picker shows what a candidate would *add*, so a history row
reads like the token rows next to it: `git com<TAB>` offers `commit` (the
sub-command) and `commit -m "fix typo"` (from history) side by side, both
starting from the `com` the user typed.

## History candidates

Because a history entry spans several arguments, it can suggest things no
per-argument completer could produce:

```
cshell2> git commit <TAB>
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ -m "fix typo"                      history     │
│ --amend --no-edit                  history     │
│ doc/                                           │
│ src/                                           │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

`Shell._get_completions` is a thin wrapper that merges these on top of the
completer-driven candidates from `_get_base_completions`, so history reaches
*every* position — command name, sub-command, argument, and the stages of a
pipeline (`ls | grep fo<TAB>` matches past lines starting with `ls | grep fo`).

The rules that keep the merge from degrading the existing UX:

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| History rows are listed **first** | "What I ran before" is the most likely intent |
| Suppressed when nothing is typed | A bare TAB should list available commands; Up/Down and `Ctrl+R` already cover recall with an empty line |
| Suppressed on the flag picker (all candidates `multi_select`) | One history candidate would demote the Space-to-toggle checkbox picker to a plain list |
| Suppressed on the arg-hint (a lone `is_arg_hint`) | The editor renders that lone candidate as a hint line; a second candidate turns it into a picker |
| Excluded from flag-value pickers (`_prompt_for_arg`) | A history tail is not a value for the flag being filled in |
| Never auto-applied | Every "exactly one candidate" shortcut in `lineedit._complete` counts only single-token candidates, so a unique token completion still applies on the first TAB, and a lone history candidate is always *shown* before it inserts several arguments |

The last rule has a visible consequence worth knowing: when a position has
exactly one token candidate, the first TAB auto-applies it and the history rows
are not shown. They are one TAB away — press it again on the now-longer line.
The alternative (opening a picker whenever history matches) would cost a
keystroke on completions that used to be instant.

**TAB-extend and the raw anchor.** `TAB` inside a picker types the longest shared
prefix of the candidate *values*, which requires every value to live in the same
space as the prefix it is measured against. Anchored history values nearly share
the token's space, with one exception: they start at the *raw* anchor, while
`ctx.prefix` is what shlex left after stripping quotes — so for `cat 'My Do<TAB>`
the history value begins with `'`. `lineedit._complete` therefore picks one space
per TAB press: a history-only list measures against the raw token text
(`line[raw_token_start(line):]`), while a mixed list measures the token prefix
(`ctx.prefix` as recomputed for the current line) and drops the verbatim rows
from the measurement.

The choice is re-made on every TAB, not fixed when the picker opened, because
narrowing moves both halves of the subtraction:

- A **mixed list can narrow to history rows only** — `make job <TAB>` opens with
  file candidates alongside the history tails, and typing `J` drops the files.
- **Typing a space moves the anchor.** History candidates match in line space, so
  they keep matching across a token boundary and the picker stays open; the
  values are then anchored one token further right.

Both cases used to leave a stale, too-long prefix on the measuring side, so the
extension came out empty and `TAB` appeared to do nothing. The picker delegates
the whole computation to the `extend_fn(items, typed)` callback `_complete`
supplies (`InlinePicker`'s simpler `value_fn` + `completion_prefix` pair still
serves the flag-value picker, where the value space is fixed).

Picker column alignment (`_picker_col_offset`) measures history rows *with*
everything else, since anchored values normally do start with the typed token —
that is what opens a history-only picker under the token instead of at the caret.
Only when including them shares nothing (again, the quoted token) does it fall
back to measuring the token rows alone.

## How TAB Completion Works

The line editor (`lineedit.py`) calls `_get_completions(line_before_cursor)` on every TAB press. The shell implements this as:

```
_get_completions(line_before_cursor)
  → _get_base_completions(line_before_cursor)   ← the dispatch chain below
  → HistoryCompleter, unless the base result is a flag picker or an arg-hint
      → prepend the matching entries' tails from the anchor (verbatim=True)

_get_base_completions(line_before_cursor)
  → _split_on_operators() → isolate current pipeline stage
  → split_for_completion(stage) → (tokens, prefix)
  → No tokens?
      → CommandNameCompleter
  → Has tokens?
      → Look up command in registry (or external completers)
      → completers[None] present AND prefix starts with "-"?
          → Check if last arg is a value-taking flag (preceding-flag hint)
              → Yes, has value_completer → return value_completer.complete(ctx)
              → Yes, hint only → return [is_arg_hint=True Completion]
          → options_completer.complete(ctx) if should_activate()
      → No options matches yet, completers[arg_index] present?
          → positional_completer.complete(ctx) if should_activate()
      → Still no matches?
          → Try CobraCompleter (if command speaks the cobra __complete protocol)
          → Try ArgcompleteCompleter (if command is an argcomplete-marked Python script)
      → Still no matches and no completer registered? → FileCompleter fallback
```

**Protocol fallbacks** layer onto the dispatch chain after registered completers fail. They use the same `Completer` interface and a per-command probe-cache so a single TAB on a known-cobra/known-argcomplete tool stays fast. See [cobra-fallback.md](cobra-fallback.md) and [argcomplete-fallback.md](argcomplete-fallback.md) for protocol details.

Once completions are returned to the line editor:

| Situation | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| Zero completions | Do nothing |
| Single `is_arg_hint` completion | Show inline hint below buffer; cleared on next keypress |
| Single `multi_select` + `arg_hint` completion | Auto-apply the flag (insert `flag `), then loop again to handle the value |
| Single non-hint completion | Apply immediately; if it has `arg_hint`, then prompt for the value |
| All `multi_select` | Open `InlineMultiPicker` |
| Mixed | Open `InlinePicker` (narrows as user types more characters) |

Every "single completion" row above counts **single-token** candidates only;
`verbatim` (history) candidates are excluded, so they never auto-apply and never
turn a unique token completion into a picker. See
[History candidates](#history-candidates).

Auto-apply on a single completion only fires on the **initial** TAB press.
If the user is narrowing inside an open picker and the candidate count
drops to one, the picker stays open on that lone item — the user can't
see the count cross the threshold mid-typing, so a sudden close + insert
would feel like the shell is finishing the word for them out of nowhere.
Press Enter to apply, or TAB to extend the common prefix explicitly.

### Nothing is selected until the user selects it

Both completion pickers open with **no row highlighted** (`select_first=False`
on the widget). Enter on a freshly opened list therefore inserts nothing — it
just dismisses the list, leaving the line exactly as typed. To accept a
candidate the user makes the choice explicit:

- `Down` / `Ctrl+N` (or `Up` / `Ctrl+P` to enter at the bottom), then `Enter`
- `TAB` on a list narrowed to a single candidate accepts it outright

The alternative — highlighting the first candidate on open — means a reflexive
Enter silently rewrites the argument the user just typed.

`TAB` inside an open picker *only* types the longest shared prefix of the
remaining candidates. When there is nothing left to extend it does nothing:
moving the selection is the user's job, and a TAB that quietly highlighted a
row would re-introduce the same surprise from the other direction.

### An empty candidate list never stays open

While a picker is open, typed characters are echoed by the *picker*; they are
committed to the line buffer when it closes. Two rules keep that from losing
input:

1. If typing (or backspacing) narrows the list to zero candidates, the picker
   closes itself (`InlinePicker.closed_empty`). Previously it stayed open
   rendering zero rows — invisible, but still consuming keystrokes, and Enter
   then discarded everything typed since TAB.
2. `lineedit._complete` / `_prompt_for_arg` commit `picker.typed` into the
   buffer on **every** exit path — accept, dismiss, Esc, or empty-close — so
   the redraw on return can never erase characters the user saw echoed.

The **fallback to `FileCompleter`** only triggers when **no completer** is registered for that position. If a completer is registered but returns empty results, no fallback occurs — commands can explicitly declare "no completions here" by registering a completer that returns `[]`.

## Per-Argument Binding

Python commands declare arguments via a single `params=[arg(...)]` list. Each `arg()` configures argparse (validation, type coercion, defaults, action) **and** TAB completion in one place — `completer=` on a positional drives completion of the value at that position; `completer=` on a value-taking flag drives completion of the value typed after the flag. The registry derives the underlying `{arg_index: Completer, None: OptionsCompleter}` dict automatically.

```python
from cshell2.commands import registry, arg
from cshell2.completion import ChoiceCompleter

@registry.command(
    name="deploy",
    help="Deploy a service to an environment.",
    params=[
        # choices= drives both argparse validation AND TAB completion.
        arg("environment", choices=["prod", "staging", "dev"]),
        arg("region",      completer=RegionCompleter()),
        arg("service",     completer=ServiceCompleter()),  # may inspect ctx.args
        # Boolean flags
        arg("-v", "--verbose",  action="store_true",   help="verbose output"),
        arg("-n", "--dry-run",  action="store_true",   help="skip execution"),
        # Value-taking flag with a value completer
        arg("-t", "--timeout",  type=int, metavar="SECONDS",
                                completer=ChoiceCompleter(["30", "60", "120"])),
    ],
)
def deploy(environment, region, service, verbose, dry_run, timeout):
    ...
```

This design means:
- Each `arg()` is independent — positionals declared in order, flags can appear anywhere in the list
- Positionals without a `completer=` (and no `choices=`) fall back to file completion at that index
- Later completers see earlier args via `ctx.args`
- All flags collected into a single `OptionsCompleter` under `None` — activated whenever the user types a `-`-prefixed token

External recipes use the same `params=[arg(...)]` form, registered without a handler. The dispatch path treats handler-less Commands as external recipes and falls through to the system-command path:

```python
from cshell2.commands import arg, registry as command_registry
from cshell2.completion import FileCompleter

command_registry.command(
    "rsync",
    help="fast incremental file transfer",
    params=[
        arg("paths", nargs="*", completer=FileCompleter()),
        arg("-a", action="store_true", help="archive"),
        arg("-v", action="store_true", help="verbose"),
        arg("-n", action="store_true", help="dry run"),
        arg("--exclude", metavar="PATTERN", help="exclude pattern"),
    ],
)
```

## Writing Custom Completers

### Basic Pattern

```python
class MyCompleter(Completer):
    def complete(self, ctx: CompletionContext) -> list[Completion]:
        return [
            Completion(value=item, description=desc)
            for item, desc in self._get_items()
            if item.startswith(ctx.prefix)
        ]
```

### Context-Aware Pattern

```python
class EC2InstanceCompleter(Completer):
    def complete(self, ctx: CompletionContext) -> list[Completion]:
        # Use preceding args or fall back to shell context
        account = ctx.args[0] if ctx.args else ctx.shell_context.get_variable("account")
        region = ctx.args[1] if len(ctx.args) > 1 else ctx.shell_context.get_variable("region")
        instances = fetch_instances(account, region)
        return [
            Completion(value=i["id"], description=i["name"])
            for i in instances
            if i["id"].startswith(ctx.prefix)
        ]
```

### Caching Pattern

For completers that call expensive APIs, cache results keyed on the relevant arguments:

```python
class CachedCompleter(Completer):
    def __init__(self):
        self._cache: dict[tuple, list[Completion]] = {}

    def complete(self, ctx: CompletionContext) -> list[Completion]:
        key = tuple(ctx.args[:2])
        if key not in self._cache:
            self._cache[key] = self._fetch(ctx.args[0], ctx.args[1])
        return [c for c in self._cache[key] if c.value.startswith(ctx.prefix)]
```

## Parsing for Completion

`split_for_completion(line)` splits the input line into tokens and a trailing prefix:

- `"git commit "` → `(["git", "commit"], "")`
- `"git commit -m hel"` → `(["git", "commit", "-m"], "hel")`
- `"git "` → `(["git"], "")`
- `"gi"` → `([], "gi")`

The distinction between completed tokens (in `args`) and the in-progress token (in `prefix`) is critical for routing completions correctly.

Completion is always scoped to the **current pipeline stage**: for `ls | grep -`, the completion context uses `grep` as the command, not `ls`.

For a practical guide to adding completions for external commands, see [`doc/recipes.md`](recipes.md).
