"""The output contract for the whole ``awsut`` command tree.

Every ``awsut`` leaf that prints a resource listing prints it the same way, and
this module is the only place that shape is defined:

* **A header line, then a blank line.**  ``N thing(s) · <scope> · region <r>`` —
  how many, of what, from where.  It is also the answer when there are none:
  :func:`print_table` prints nothing for an empty row list, so the header is
  what says "asked, and there were zero".
* **A table.**  ALL-CAPS column labels, a ``-`` rule, two spaces between
  columns, and **widths from the data** so an identifier is never truncated —
  every cell can be copied straight into the next command.
* **Notes only for facts about this output**: rows hidden by a filter, rows cut
  by ``--max``, a query that was refused.  Not a legend, and not advice — a
  sentence that reads the same on every run belongs in the command's ``help=``,
  where it is available on demand instead of costing three lines per listing.
* **Detail views** (``describe``) open with a :func:`print_labeled` block whose
  labels are the API's own field names, then use tables for the nested lists.
  Anything after that block that isn't a table gets a :func:`section` heading,
  so the eye can find where one field's worth of output ends and the next
  begins without counting blank lines.
* **Failures** read like shell errors: ``error: <message>`` on stderr, lowercase,
  the resource quoted.  :func:`guard` on the leaf turns the expected AWS and
  usage failures into that one line.
* **Timestamps** are local and second-precision (:func:`fmt_time`); the change
  lines a ``watch`` loop emits are stamped ``[HH:MM:SS]``.

It lives at the top of ``recipes/`` — above ``awsut.py`` and above every
per-service subpackage (``_awsut_sagemaker``, ``_awsut_agentcore``) — and
deliberately builds no AWS clients, so any of them can import it without an
import cycle.  Each subpackage's ``render`` module re-exports these names, since
its own modules already read their instruments from there.

Beyond the print contract it also holds the instruments that are about *AWS
shapes* rather than about any one service, because a second service group would
otherwise copy them:

* **Model introspection** (:func:`model_enum`, :func:`input_members`) — offline
  reads of the loaded botocore model, so a command can say "this botocore has no
  such operation" instead of raising ``AttributeError``.
* **Token pagination** (:func:`paged`), whose token member names differ per API
  and are therefore parameters.
* **JSON rendering** (:func:`yaml_lines`) — nesting by indentation, one value
  per line, never wrapped, because the values worth reading in an API response
  (ARNs, ``s3://`` URIs) are exactly the ones a wrapped dump breaks.  Purely
  structural: nothing here knows a single key name.
* **Value shapes** (:func:`split_arn`, :func:`split_s3`, :func:`version_key`).
* **Watch heartbeat** (:class:`Heartbeat`, :func:`sleep_with_dots`) — the run of
  dots that makes "polled, nothing changed" visible.
* **Completion-context readers** (:func:`flag_value`, :func:`positionals`) for a
  completer that must narrow by an already-typed flag.

What stays in a subpackage's ``render`` is whatever needs a *client* or knows
that service's own vocabulary.
