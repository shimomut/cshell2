"""Shared instruments for the ``awsut sagemaker`` tree.

Everything in here is presentation or plumbing that the ``jobs``, ``hub``,
``studio`` and ``hyperpod`` groups need.  It lives in one module so they cannot
drift in how they render the same data — several of these APIs hand back opaque
JSON documents, and all of them are read by following ARNs out of them.

The output contract itself — table shape, header line, note policy, ``error:``
lines — is one level up, in :mod:`cshell2.recipes._awsut_common`, because the
rest of ``awsut`` (``ec2``, ``logs``, ``cloudformation``, and the
``bedrock-agentcore`` group) prints to the same contract.  So are the
instruments that are about AWS shapes rather than about SageMaker: model
introspection, token pagination, the YAML-ish JSON renderer, ARN/S3 splitting,
the watch heartbeat, and the completion-context flag readers.  All of those
names are re-exported here, so a module in this package still reads every
instrument it needs off ``render``.

What this module adds on top is SageMaker-specific:

* **Documents are reformatted, never interpreted.**  ``JobConfigDocument`` and
  ``HubContentDocument`` are modelled by the service as opaque strings.
  Nothing here knows a single key name: structure is followed by *value
  shape* (an ARN says what it points at, an ``s3://`` URI says it is a
  location) and the JSON path a value was read from travels with it as
  provenance.
* **Clients and CloudWatch reading**, plus the ``require_*`` guards that turn a
  model too old for an operation into an explanation rather than an
  ``AttributeError``.

Region, profile, endpoint and service-name all come from the enclosing
``awsut`` recipe, i.e. from ``var aws_region=`` / ``var aws_profile=`` /
``var sagemaker_endpoint=`` / ``var sagemaker_service_name=`` at the prompt —
these commands deliberately have no ``--region`` / ``--profile`` flags.
