"""``awsut sagemaker jobs`` — SageMaker Job resources at the service-API level.

Talks to ListJobs / DescribeJob / StopJob through the ``awsut`` boto3 client
factory, so what you see is the raw service response rather than an SDK
rendering of it.  ``log`` reads the job's own output from CloudWatch, whose
group name is derived from the category (see :data:`JOB_LOG_GROUP_ROOT`).

Deliberate differences from the SDK's own status panel:

* Identifiers print in full, never wrapped or ellipsized, so they can be
  copied into other commands and tickets.  ``list`` is one line per job with
  a header row; column widths come from the data.
* ``describe`` always prints ``JobConfigDocument``, reformatted YAML-style.
  That document is where a job's S3 paths and model choices actually live —
  DescribeJob has no input/output members, only an opaque JSON string — so
  hiding it behind a flag would hide the most-wanted part of the response.
  ``--raw-config`` gives the string verbatim; ``--raw`` gives the whole API
  response as JSON.
* ``watch`` prints only on change, so a long job leaves a readable timeline
  rather than a repainted frame.  With no ``JOB_NAME`` it watches every job
  matching the ``list`` filters and reports each status change, printing a
  ``.`` heartbeat every 5s while nothing moves — so silence is visibly "still
  polling", not "hung".  ``Ctrl+C`` detaches.
* ``log`` finds the stream rather than making the user name it: a stream is
  ``<job>/<phase>-<timestamp>``, so it cannot be spelled from the job name
  alone.  A job with no stream is explained by its status rather than reported
  as an error — one too early to have logged and one whose logs aged out are
  both empty, and only the status tells them apart.

``JobCategory`` is **required** by both ListJobs and DescribeJob, so a job
cannot be looked up by name alone.  When ``--category`` is omitted,
``describe`` / ``watch`` / ``stop`` probe the known categories and report
which one matched, and ``list`` queries all of them.

The queried set is the loaded botocore model's ListJobs enum, unioned with
any category named in :data:`EXTRA_JOB_CATEGORIES` (empty by default;
configurable — see that constant).  ``--category extra`` narrows to the
latter.

Neither kind of category failure is fatal, and the two are told apart (see
:func:`category_not_offered`): a category the endpoint does not offer at all
is reported once as a compact "not offered by this endpoint" note, while a
category that should have worked and didn't (no permission, throttling) gets a
stderr line naming the service's own message.
