"""Shared instruments for the ``awsut bedrock-agentcore`` tree.

Everything in here is plumbing or vocabulary that the AgentCore groups need and
that is not specific to any one of them: the control-plane client, the status
words every AgentCore resource shares, and the cache-key shape its completers
use.  It lives in one module so the groups cannot drift in how they read the
same service.

The output contract — table shape, header line, note policy, ``error:`` lines —
and the service-agnostic instruments (pagination, the YAML-ish JSON renderer,
the watch heartbeat, model introspection, the completion-context flag readers)
are two levels up in :mod:`cshell2.recipes._awsut_common`, and re-exported here
so a module in this package reads every instrument off ``render``.  That is the
same arrangement ``_awsut_sagemaker.render`` uses.

Two things are worth knowing before adding a group here:

* **The control plane and the data plane are different services**, and a
  resource can span both.  ``bedrock-agentcore-control`` creates and describes
  resources (harnesses, memories); ``bedrock-agentcore`` reaches *into* them —
  what a memory has stored, what a runtime answers.  So a group may need both
  clients: ``memory`` uses :func:`control_client` for the resource itself and
  :func:`data_client` for the actors, sessions, events and records inside it.
  :func:`require_operation` reads the service name off whichever client it is
  handed, so an error message always names the right one.
* **AgentCore's model is young and still growing.**  An operation this code
  calls may simply not exist in the installed botocore, so every leaf goes
  through :func:`require_operation` first — a missing operation is a
  botocore-vintage problem, and a bare ``AttributeError`` would read like a
  cshell2 bug.  For the same reason status words are read out of the loaded
  model where possible (:func:`statuses`) rather than hard-coded, and nothing
  validates a user-typed status against them.

Region and profile come from the enclosing ``awsut`` recipe, i.e. from
``var aws_region=`` / ``var aws_profile=`` at the prompt — these commands
deliberately have no ``--region`` / ``--profile`` flags.  What this group adds
is ``var agentcore_control_endpoint=`` and ``var agentcore_data_endpoint=``, for
pointing either plane at a non-default endpoint; like the ``sagemaker_*`` Vars
they are module-level Python state rather than env vars, so they don't leak into
subprocesses.
