"""TTL-based cache for completer fetches that hit external services.

TAB completion fires every keystroke while the picker is open
(``refresh_fn`` in :mod:`cshell2.lineedit` re-runs the completer on every
typed char). Completers that call AWS APIs would otherwise re-fetch the
same data four or five times for a single typed token.

Two primitives:

* :func:`get_or_fetch` — look up a cached value by *key* or compute it.
  TTL applies per entry. Exceptions are not cached: a failed fetch
  simply propagates and leaves the cache untouched.
* :func:`invalidate_all` — wipe every entry. The shell calls this after
  each pipeline finishes so a freshly-mutated cluster (e.g. after
  ``awsut hyperpod scale``) doesn't return stale completions on the next
  TAB.

Also exposes :func:`aws_env_key` so all AWS-style completers can salt
their cache keys with the active profile/region without each importing
``os.environ`` directly.
